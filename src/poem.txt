(please change versions per pull req. Minor changes should be reflected as v1.2.x(change x) and major changes should be reflected as v1.x(change x))

As my gaze fell on you, I couldn't help but smile
Felt something I haven’t felt in a while.
Something rare, and possibly new. 
My mind's favorite topic wouldn't yet be you. 

Something within told me to get close,
Got me to be with you at your highs and lows. 
All of this, yet I still didn’t have a clue
That my mind’s favorite topic would become you.

All changed when one night, I laid my head to dream. 
Within my heart, emotions burst at the seam. 
At that moment, then and there I knew,
My mind's favorite topic would be you. 

I enjoyed all the times we’ve spent together. 
No matter the occasion, with you I felt better. 
I loved you immensely, that much is true,
And my mind’s favorite topic is definitely you.

All changed when I flew too close to you, my sun,
My greed melted my wings, marking our friendship done.
As I descended through the clouds with sky blue hue,
I thought about my mind’s favorite topic: you.

Now, memories fun and memories jolly
Forever shadowed by pain and melancholy
Never has my mind been so bleak and blue
Before its favorite topic became you.

I hope to feel your grip in my mind release
To make me once again feel inner peace.
But I know that will never come true,
So long as my mind’s favorite topic is you. 

Even as I suffer, I hope you’re happy.
Wherever you may end up without me
Even if our bond is now long due,
My mind’s favorite topic would always be you.
